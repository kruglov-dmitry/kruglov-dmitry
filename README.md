### 👋 Hi, I'm Dmitry

I build software **and** the teams that build it (with joy).  
Principal engineer, ex-CTO, startup advisor.

I help companies go from **0 → MVP**, and MVP → **scale**.  

⚙️ 20+ years across B2B, B2C, and deep tech  
🚀 Built platforms serving **50k+ users**, 3x’d performance, cut time-to-market by 75%  
🧱 Hands-on: lately a lot of FastAPI, NextJS, Rust, K8S and Terraform

### What I care about

- **KISS** > DRY
- **TEAM** >> IC
- **LEARN** => **GROWTH**
- Engineers who think in **PRODUCT** terms
