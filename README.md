üëã Hi there!

My name is Dmitry.

I build software and teams that build software (with joy).  

Distributed systems, data and backend.  
Performance tuning.  
Lately a lot of flutter based development.


# What am I about?

- **KISS** > **DRY**
  - **YAGNI** - as a efficient pill to prevent over-engineering
  - simple is not necessary easy to build
- **TEAM** >> IC
  - term "simplicity" should be **ALIGNED** among team
  - **SHARE** knowledge - ask & show = pair/mob & try things (REPL for the rescue!)
  - **TRUST** is essential
- "**Small batches**" + "**good enough**" = **fast** iterative delivery
- **CI/CD** with **tests** + **Observability** = determine pace of the project
- **DATA** - is still a new oil, and it requires decent care
- **LEARN**, especially **by doing**(!) (especially(!!!) **from mistakes**) = **GROWTH**
- **FOCUS** time without interruptions - where magic happen
- spread **PRODUCT mentality among eng** - it maximise application of talent (and boost spirit)
  - Why and Why now >> How
- **TECH DEBT** definition depend on product's and company's stage:
  - not all bugs should be fixed, not all bugs should be fixed now 

oh, and one last, but very important:

## Engineering is fun! :D
